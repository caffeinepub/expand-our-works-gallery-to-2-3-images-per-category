However, the provided (truncated) `ContactSection.tsx` diff does not show the specific `<a href=\"tel:...\">` link update, and the diff summary does not provide repo-wide evidence that all occurrences of `6374350379` were removed. Additionally, metadata/state files were modified that were not requested by the BuildRequest.",
